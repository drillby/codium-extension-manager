# Codium extension manager (CEM)

## What is CEM?
CEM is a solo project that aims to be a extension manager for [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/). It is written in [Go](https://golang.org/).

## Why CEM?
I created CEM because I wanted to have a extension manager for VSCodium. VSCodium has limited support for extensions, but you can manually install extensions from VSCode. I wanted to have a extension manager that would allow me to install extensions from the command line.

**Rest of the README will be written later, when the project is more complete.**
