# Codium extension manager (CEM)

## What is CEM?
CEM is a solo project that aims to be a extension manager for [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/). It is written in [Go](https://golang.org/).

## Why CEM?
I created CEM because I wanted to have a extension manager for VSCodium. VSCodium has limited support for extensions, but you can manually install extensions from VSCode. I wanted to have a extension manager that would allow me to install extensions from the command line.

## How to use CEM?
CEM is still in development, so it is not ready for use yet. However, if you want to try it out, you can download the source code and build it yourself.

### Building CEM
To build CEM, you need to have Go installed. You can download Go from [here](https://golang.org/dl/). After you have installed Go, you can build CEM by running the following command in the root directory of the project:
```
go build -o build/cem
```
This will create a executable file called `cem` in the root directory of the project. You can run this file to use CEM.

### Build functionallity
